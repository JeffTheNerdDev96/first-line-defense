Think of it as your personal, always-available security bookmark, right in your browser.

Instant Access: One-click navigation to URL and file submission pages.
Privacy First: Absolutely no sign-ins, no data collection, and no tracking whatsoever. Your browser remains private.
Simplicity: Designed to be straightforward and perform its single function exceptionally well.
Lightweight: Minimal impact on your browser's performance.

This extension is built with your privacy in mind. It does NOT:

    Collect any personal data.
    Require any sign-ins or accounts.
    Track your Browse activity.

It simply provides a direct link to a third-party service
